# EnvironmentalDataMonitoring
AI system that can collect, process, and analyze various types of environmental data. The system provides insights and visualizations to understand the current state of the environment.

# Air pollution notebook
The airpollution jupyter notebook has been trained on the dataset available in the google drive link above. This file achieves the following: -
1. Merging and cleaning the data, dealing with null values and formatting the data
2. Creating plots to better interpret the data
3. Implementing EDA techniques to visualize the data
4. Training a multi-linear regression model on relation inferred from EDA
To successfully run the notebook file ensure the path has been set correctly.


# Current Data Visualization
Current data was obtained from weather websites and output to the csv file statewise. This was then visualized using Power BI. The dashboard "Airpresent" has graphs representing this data in an easy to understand and coherent manner. The datafile can be updated with more recent data to automatically update the visuals.
